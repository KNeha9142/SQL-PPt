# SQL Project: Online Bus Booking System.

In this project, I developed a comprehensive database system for managing online bus bookings using SQL. The system was designed to handle various aspects of bus services, including user data, bus schedules, bookings, payments, and reviews. Key highlights of the project include:

Entity-Relationship Model (ER Diagram): Defined relationships between entities such as Users, Buses, Schedules, Routes, Bookings, Payments, and Reviews. Key relationships include:

One-to-many: Users to Bookings, Buses to Schedules, Routes to Schedules, etc.
One-to-one: Bookings to Payments.
Database Design: Created multiple tables including Users, Buses, Routes, Schedules, Bookings, Payments, and Reviews to efficiently store and manage data.

SQL Queries: Implemented a range of SQL queries for various operations such as:

Fetching total revenue from completed payments.
Listing confirmed bookings for users who have completed payments.
Displaying buses with confirmed bookings.
Retrieving highest payment amounts for each bus route.
Fetching bookings for users traveling from specific origins (e.g., 'Mumbai' to 'Pune').
Joins and Subqueries: Used complex SQL joins (INNER, LEFT) and subqueries to display relationships between users, bookings, buses, schedules, and payments. For example:

Showing bus schedules along with the routes they cover, including distance and price.
Listing reviews for buses and the corresponding user details.
Displaying the total amount paid by each user.
This project enhanced my skills in database design, query optimization, and working with relational databases to create efficient solutions for real-world business problems.
